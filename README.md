# Meanscout Api (RUST EDITION)
An attempt at making the meanscout api in rust for maybe better safety<br>
(and honestly I trust this version a lot more)

## How to Build
To build it from source you first need to have [rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed, and then cd into the directory and use the command `cargo build`<br>
When it is done building, the binary will be located in `/target/debug/` as `meanapi`
